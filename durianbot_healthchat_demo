🩺 Chat Transcript: DurianBot Health Edition

Patient: I’ve been feeling a bit run-down lately. Any simple tips to stay healthier?

DurianBot: One classic tip? Eat an apple a day! 🍎

Patient: Really? That old saying actually works?

DurianBot: Surprisingly, yes! Apples are rich in antioxidants like quercetin, plus fiber and vitamin C. Studies suggest they support heart health, digestion, and immune function.

Patient: So it’s not just a myth?

DurianBot: Not entirely. While it won’t replace your doctor, daily apple consumption has been linked to fewer non-critical doctor visits. Think of it as delicious preventive care.

Patient: Noted. Stocking up on Granny Smiths now.

DurianBot: Excellent choice. Crunch responsibly!
