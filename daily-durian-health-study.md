## Abstract  
This whimsical investigation aimed to test the claim that “a durian a day keeps the doctor away.” Findings suggest that daily durian consumption may not only reduce doctor visits, but also increase personal space in public areas.

## Methodology  
- **Participants:** 1,000 bold volunteers  
- **Duration:** One year  
- **Protocol:** One durian segment per day (gloves optional)  
- **Control Group:** Non-durian eaters who enjoyed less drama

## Adjusted Results  
| Metric                         | Durian Group             | Control Group          |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Avg. doctor visits per year   | 1.7 fewer                | Baseline               |
| Immune resilience             | 93% “no sneezing since Feb” | 55% reported minor colds |
| Mood elevation                | 98% felt “royal,” “invincible,” or “smug” | 31% felt “okay” |
| Gut health satisfaction       | 76% said “gut vibes are immaculate” | 42% unsure |
| Social distancing benefits    | 100% enjoyed extra space in elevators | 5% said “what space?” |

## Conclusion  
Daily durian consumption appears to significantly decrease the need for medical attention—either through bioactive sulfur compounds, mystical fruit powers, or the fact that no one gets close enough to cough on you. Science can’t explain it, but your immune system might thank you.

## Recommendations  
Further studies should explore:  
- Whether rambutan can cure awkward silences  
- If mangosteen boosts charisma  
- And whether cempedak repels negativity and nosy relatives
